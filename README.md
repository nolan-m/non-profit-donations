##Non-profit donations

http://non-profit-donations.herokuapp.com/

* Current non-profits are displayed on the main page.
* Users can choose non-profits to make donation using the Stripe API.
* Registered users can add their Non profit of choice to the site which allows other visitors to donate.


####Future Additions:
-----
* Now, non-profits want the option to have their donors opt for monthly donations. Use Stripe subscriptions to bill their card for $15 per month if they choose monthly donations.

* Not everyone wants to donate $15/month. Let non-profits create different donation tiers by adding subscriptions. Hint: A non-profit has many subscriptions.

* Finally, we need to actually pay out to the non-profits. Use Stripe transfers to pay out the donations to the non-profits.
